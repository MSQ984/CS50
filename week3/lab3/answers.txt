sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: second lowest running time and because bubble sort is in the middle of merge sort and selection sort in time complexity sort1 is bubble sort1.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: the most efficient sorting method with the lowest time complexity of n log n it has the lowest running time out of all and hence sort2 is merge sort.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: the least efficient sorting method with the highest time complexity of n^2 it has the highest running time out of all and hence sort3 is selection sort.
